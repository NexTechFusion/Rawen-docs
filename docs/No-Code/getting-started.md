# Your first command

Rawen offers a no-code solution to create commands. This is done by using the pure understandable Action selection or an assistant that guides you through the process.

Let's create a simple command that will exectue a simply `open the app` and display `"Hello world"`.


## Via Action Selection

1. Open the Rawen app.
2. Route to `Settings` and the `Commands` tab and hit the `Add` button
3. Add a new Action and select `Open App`
3. Add an other new Action and select `Add Result`
4. Fill in the text field with `Hello world!`
5. Hit the `Debug` button
